# 1. Customer's Goals and Pains:

Goal: Improve inventory management and reduce stock shortages or overstock issues in stores.

Pain: Stores often have either too much or too little stock due to inaccurate sales forecasting. This leads to either lost revenue from stockouts or waste from unsold perishable goods.


# 2. Value Proposition

Value: More accurate sales forecasts will enable grocery stores to better match supply with demand. This leads to fewer stockouts, less waste, increased revenue, and higher customer satisfaction.


# 3. Objectives

Predict future sales for each product family across multiple stores.

Incorporate external factors like promotions, holidays, and oil prices into the prediction model.

Reduce the prediction error (RMSLE).

Ensure the model scales across different stores and product categories.
